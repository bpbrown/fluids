In the same way that a negative temperature gradient can lead to convective instability, a negative entropy gradient can lead to convective instability in a stratified atmosphere.  And in the same way that temperature is the bouyancy variable for Boussinesq fluids (hot things go up, cold things fall down), entropy is the generalization for stratifed atmospheres (high entropy goes up, low entropy falls down).  In atmospheric sciences, entropy is often written in the form of a (possibly confusing) \"potential temperature\", but you can see that the two are related, and in my opinion entropy is a bit simpler to think about.\n"
