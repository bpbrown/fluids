    "1. In lecture 1, I assert that $e_{ij}$ is the \"pure shear\" part of the expansion of $\\partial u_i/\\partial x_j$ while the other term is pure rotation.  Show this by substituting a pure rotational flow $u_i = \\epsilon_{ikl}\\Omega_k x_l$ and showing that $e_{ij}$ vanishes and that the other term is pure rotation.\n",
