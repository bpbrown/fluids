    "This does some snazzy things.  First, a coarse grid of eigen problems is solved at various $k_x$.  At each $k_x$, $N_z$ many (potentially) unstable modes are solved for, and the critical mode at each $k_x$ is found and it's $\\mathrm{Ra}_c$ is plotted.  These are the blue points.  We use that discrete grid to find the smallest $\\mathrm{Ra}_c$, and from there we try to find the best actual critical value by doing a bracketing search.  This is all done using `scipy.optimize`, which is where you should start from when faced with similar problems; techniques like this are related to concepts of minimization and zero or \"root\" finding.  \n",

    "This numerical approach, incidentally, is also how we would compute convective onset in a non-constant coefficient atmosphere, as you did for waves in AS21.  We could also handle subcritical bifurcations and oscillatory onset, but that's a bit more sophisticated (you might see it in *ASTR 5410: Waves & Instabilities*, should you choose to take that class).\n",
    "\n",
    "For problems with oscillatory onset, you would need to solve for $\\omega$ as the complex eigenvalue on a 2-d grid in both $k_x$ and $\\mathrm{Ra}$, and then search (root-find) this 2-d grid to see where the imaginary part of $\\omega = \\omega_r + i \\omega_i$ is zero (where $\\omega_i=0$).  This more general technique can work quite well.  When doing this, one should be careful to reject spurious solutions to the eigenvalue/eigenfunction problem, using a tool like `eigentools` to automatically test for solution convergence.  You need to be a bit careful if you want to do this accurately, but the examples in the [`eigentools` repository](https://github.com/DedalusProject/eigentools) and JOSS paper [(Oishi et al 2021)](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-papers/blob/joss.03079/joss.03079/10.21105.joss.03079.pdf) can show you how to do it if and when you need to.  The accuracy of your solution is likely going to be limited by the sophistication of your 2-d grid search, and this is where it's good to lean on solutions like `scipy.optimize` as a starting point."
