    "\n",
    "1. Walk outside and tell me about a fluid phenomena that you see in the atmosphere.  Is it in the troposphere or the stratosphere?  Describe what you see and speculate on what is going on.\n",

    "**To Turn in**:\n",
    "Send Ben your answers to 1 & 2 via Canvas, uploading to Asynchronous Lecture 7.  Write a few sentences to a paragraph for each; include a picture if you want to and if it helps you describe things.  Please submit your text either in the text entry box or as a PDF, using any word processing program, including Jupyter notebooks.  Photos if any can be in the same PDF or uploaded separately.  Send by noon, Thursday Feb 11."
