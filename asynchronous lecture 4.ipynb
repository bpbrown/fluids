    "For our first asynchronous class, please watch 5 youtube videos about heat conduction, the Earth and the Sun, and begin a series of lectures (2 today) on the internal energy equation.\n",

    "The content from lecture 3 \"Inside the Sun\" is based on the [\"standard solar model\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_solar_model) for the interior.  This has been tested by helioseismology (helioseismologists tend to lean on an old model, [\"Model S\"](https://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/solar_models/), and you can read *much* more in Bahcall, Serenelli & Basu 2006 [\"10,000 Standard Solar Models: A Monte Carlo Simulation\"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..165..400B/abstract).  Their work is a tour-de-force.\n",

    "After watching these lectures, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose either the Earth's atmosphere, the solar interior or the solar atmosphere.  \n",
    "    - Find profiles of T, $\\rho$ and P as functions of height, using the references above or your own sources.  \n",
    "    - Using python, plot T, $\\rho$ and P as functions of height.  You can use our RC jupyterlab resources to do this (create yourself a notebook; the dedalus kernel has matplotlib, scipy and numpy).\n",
    "    - Label your plot axes appropriately.\n",
    "    - Label a few different interesting regions.\n",
    "    - Note that you can export images from JupyterLab by dragging and dropping them from the web-browser to the desktop or to a browser tab, at least on Mac.\n",
    "    - Submit this image along with...\n",

    "2. Earth is the only terrestrial planet in our solar system that has a stratosphere.  The other rocky planets with substantial atmospheres (Venus, Mars) have deep tropospheres that link directly on to thermospheres.  Why is the Earth unique in this regard?\n",

    "**To Turn in**:\n",
    "Send Ben your answers to 1 & 2 via Canvas, uploading to Asynchronous Lecture 4.  Since you need to create a plot for part 1 using python, please submit via PDF.  That writeup can be in a jupyter notebook or via Latex, or whatever works for you.  Send it by noon, Tuesday Feb 2."
