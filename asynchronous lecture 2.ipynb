Go to their webpage, click \"Request an account\", click \"University of Colorado, Boulder\" and continue from there.  You must do this before Wednesday's class, as you will need it for that class and for your first homework.\n",

    "2. The Earth's atmosphere is clearly not isothermal: it's cold on top of mountains.  Here, assume the Earth's atmosphere is polytropic in nature and assume that the troposphere is adiabatically stratified.  Calculate $\\nabla T$ for the troposphere.  Make reasonable assumptions and state them; report your answer in units of K/km.\n",
