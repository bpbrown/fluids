    "============================\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's asynchronous lecture takes us to more tools for understanding and describing flows, here both irrotational and incompressible, and linkages between the two.\n",

    "# Homework\n",
    "You're working on your Homework 3.  I know; you've heard this before.  But seriously: don't put this off.\n",

    "Please watch these videos on flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Connections between streamfunctions and streamlines](https://youtu.be/X1LA5E_ry9U)\n",
    "2. [Potential flows (good for irrotational flow)](https://youtu.be/O4LBBXysFMo)\n",
    "3. [Combining streamfunctions with velocity potentials](https://youtu.be/HTBSxKJ8wwg)\n",
    "4. [Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities](https://vimeo.com/187121815)"

    "1. Describe what you're seeing in the last video (Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities).  This is a classic shear instability.  This video comes from [Lecoanet et al 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455.4274L/abstract), a copy of which is available on Canvas.\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    f(z) = U_0 \\left(z + \\frac{a^2}{z}\\right) = \\phi + i \\psi\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $U_0$ is the flow far from the cylinder, and $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are the 2-d potential and streamfunctions respectively.  Plot the streamlines of this flow and plot the velocity potential of this flow.\n",

    "Send Ben your answers to 1-4 via Canvas, uploading to Asynchronous Lecture 10.  These can be done pencil and paper or typed up.  Send by noon, Thursday Feb 25."
